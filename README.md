*   Although its locations are limited, we feel that its comprehensive list of moving services, commitment to customer service, and long history in the moving business. This is one good option to consider for your local move.

*   As we mentioned before, U-Haul is a household name in the moving industry—and for good reason. U-Haul is the oldest and most popular option for moving truck rentals and offers five truck sizes to accommodate any-sized local move.

# PODS  
--------------------------------

![](https://www.wowmover.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/podsLogo.png)

*   PODS, short for Portable On Demand Storage, is one of the largest and most popular storage container companies in the business. We like PODS because it offers some of the highest-quality containers in the industry and has plenty of container options to suit any sized local move.

# Budget Truck Rental 
-----------------------------------------------

<img src="https://www.wowmover.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/logo-1.png" alt="budget truck rental" width="300" height="100">
 
 

*   Availability aside, Budget is a great option if you’re hoping to save some money on your local move. Although you may have to pay more for add-ons like appliance dollies and furniture pads, you’ll likely pay less at Budget than another truck rental company if you forego these options.

# 1-800-PACK-RAT  
------------------------------------------

<img src="https://www.wowmover.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1800PACKRAT-Logo-1.png" alt="1-800-pack-rat" width="300" height="100">
 

*   One of the best reasons to choose 1-800-PACK-RAT for your local move is for the moving containers themselves. Their steel construction and barn-style doors offer solid protection for your belongings while offering you more interior space than a container with roll-up doors (like those offered by PODS).

# Penske  
-----------------------------------

<img src="https://www.wowmover.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Penske-Logo.jpg" alt="Penske Truck Rental" width="300" height="100">
 

*   Penske Truck Rental is the third-largest truck rental company in the country. Although its fleet of trucks is among the newest in the industry, we’ve found that local movers may end up paying a bit more with Penske than with either U-Haul or Budget Truck Rental.
